# Navier-Stokes equation

The 2D Navier-Stokes equation is a parabolic PDE that consists of a pairof partial differential equations that describe the behavior of incompressible fluid flow in twodimensional space. They are widely used in fluid dynamics to model the motion of fluids, such as air and water, in various engineering and scientific applications. The system has the formulation
as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned} {{{}}} & {{} {{} {{\frac{\partial u} {\partial t}}+\lambda_{1} ( u \frac{\partial u} {\partial x}+v \frac{\partial u} {\partial y} )=-\frac{\partial p} {\partial x}+\lambda_{2} ( \frac{\partial^{2} u} {\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} u} {\partial v^{2}} )}}} \\ {{{}}} & {{} {{} {{\frac{\partial v} {\partial t}}+\lambda_{1} ( u \frac{\partial v} {\partial x}+v \frac{\partial v} {\partial y} )=-\frac{\partial p} {\partial y}+\lambda_{2} ( \frac{\partial^{2} u} {\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} u} {\partial v^{2}} )}}} \\ \end{aligned} 
$$
